## Examples

* [Getting_Started](Getting_Started) Examples showing how to run basic workflows.
* [batch_conformer_search](batch_conformer_search) Example showing how to run a batch of conformer searches over different SMILES strings.
* [custom_conformer_search](custom_conformer_search) Example showing how to run a customized conformer search using 3 stages of DFT filters at different levels of theory.
* [excited_states](excited_states) Example comparing the results of computing excited states with CIS and RPA methods.
* [fsapt](fsapt) Examples showing how to run F-SAPT calculations via the Promethium API.
* [hessian_timings](hessian_timings) Example showing a geometry optimization + frequency calculation with the `print_hessian_timings` flag set to `True`.
* [interaction_energy](interaction_energy) Example showing how to run an Interaction Energy workflow via the Promethium API.
* [reaction_paths](reaction_paths) Example showing a grid search, calculating four reaction paths for solvent-mediated proton transfer. One in the gas phase, one with one explicit water, one with two waters and one with three. The results show that two water molecules most effectively mediate the proton transfer (i.e. have the lowest barrier).
* [results_parsing](results_parsing) Example showing extracting the results ZIP file and loading artifacts.
* [scf_properties](scf_properties) Examples showing how to work with SCF properties.
* [sequential_GO_to_SPC](sequential_GO_to_SPC) Example showing a geometry optimization with B3LYP/def2-SVP and a single point on the optimized structure with B3LYP/def2-TZVP.
* [ts_endpoints_demo](ts_endpoint_demo) This example takes reactant and product structures from the same paper as above and runs a TS optimization from endpoints.
* [ts_opt_demo](ts_opt_demo) This example takes a transition state structure from the supplemental material of a [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja4034439) and runs a transition state optimization on it.
* [uhf_broken_symmetry](uhf_broken_symmetry) This example shows a geometry optimization using a spin broken UHF wave function.
