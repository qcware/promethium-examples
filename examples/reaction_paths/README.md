## Example

Calculates four reaction paths for solvent-mediated proton transfer. One in the gas phase, one with one explicit water, one with two waters and one with three. The results show that two water molecules most effectively mediate the proton transfer (i.e. have the lowest barrier).

To run:
```
PYTHONPATH=.. python run.py
```
